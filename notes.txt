- more expensive

Types of Computer

	- Micro Computer
		- Home Computer
		- Personal Computer
	- Main Frame Computer
	- Super Computer
	- Mini Computer

- Hybrid

Classification of Computers according to Data Handling
1. Analog Computer
	- a form of computer that uses physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical or hydroulic quantities to solve problems.
	
2. Digital Computer
	- a computer that performs calculations and logical operations with quantities, numerical or otherwise, represented as digits, usually in the binary number system (zeroes and ones).
	
3. Hybrid Computer
	- a combination of computers that are capable of inputting and outputting in both digital and analog signals. Tends to be more cost effective in niche situations where the precision of analog computers, combined with the greater control of digital computers are required.
	
Classification of Computers according to Purpose
1. General Purpose Computers
	- designed to solve a large variety of problems. Most digital computers are designed this way, used in business and commercial data processing.
2. Special Purpose Computers
	- designed for more specific problems. Most analog computers are like this, which are widely used in industrial robotics.
	
Classification of Computers according to Generation
1. Vacuum Tubes
2. Transistors
3. Integrated Circuits
4. Microprocessors
5. Artificial Intelligence

Classification of Computers according to Size
1. Supercomputers
	- these are the fastest computers available in any given time. They are usually made to solve problems that are very numerically intensive. 

	- these are extremely expensive; speed is measured in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations)
	- these are also enormous, oftentimes covering a whole room just for 1 super computer.
	- these are built by interconnecting thousands of processors that can work in parallel.
	- ex. IBM Roadrunner, IBM Blue Gene, Intel ASCI Red
	- PARAM Padma (1 TFLOP); India C-DAC (Center for Development of Advanced Computing)
	
	* Drawbacks
		- requires highly qualified staff
		- experts are required for such computer engineering
		- sensitive to temperature, humidity, dust, etc.
		- 0 portability due to size
	* Application and Uses
		- weather forecasting
		- fluid dynamics 
		- nuclear simulations
		- animated graphics
		- theoretical astrophysics
		- complex scientific computations.
	
2. Mainframe Computers
	- second largest computers (in capability and in size)
	- these computers are distinguished institutional computers intended to serve a large audience.
	- in some ways, Mainframes can be faster than Supercomputers
	- its computational operations are calculated in MIPS (Millions of Instructions per Second)
	- ex. IBM ES000, VAX 8000, CDC 6600
	- supercomputers are more single minded in their executions, be really good at a few things, while mainframes are good at a lot of programs concurrently.
	
3. Mini Computers
	- lies between a mainframe and microcomputers (PC)
	- they are rated between 1 and 50 MIPS
	- in general, it can serve 4-200 users simultaneously
	- used in industries, research organizations, colleges and universities
	- modernly known as "Servers"
	
4. Micro Computers
	- the most common type of computers used today
	- introduced in the early 70's having less storage space and speed
	- they are low cost, single-user computers
	
	* Sub Types
		- Servers
		- Workstations
		- Embedded


Evolution of Computers

Alan Turing
- widely regarded as the father of modern computer science.
- in 1936, he formalized the concept of the algorithm and the Turing machine

Konrad Zuse
- father of modern computer

Number System

What is Data?
- it is simply any number, letter, or symbol that can be entered into a computer system.
- data values doen't mean anything until we put them into context.

Information = Data + Context


What is a System?
- a system is simply something that takes in INPUT,
- does something with that input which is the PROCESS,
- and lastly gives a result, which is the OUTPUT


What is a Computer?
- it is a device that stores and processes information according to a set of instructions.


How does it process Data?
- computers are used to process all types of information in a broad spectrum fields.

1. Numeric Data; consisting of integers and real numbers. We typically perform arithmetic operations on numeric data.

2. Alphanumeric Data; strings of alphabets and numbers.

3. Multimedia; including images, sound and text are frequently used in a large collection of application areas.

4. Signals


How do they store Data?
- CPU's sends packets to RAM, which is just a bunch of data.
- all data, information, instructions, files, images, etc. is stored as numbers.
- digital computers have been made such that all data and instructions for processing must first be stored in RAM.


How to store text and pictures as numbers?
- the solution is to store it using numeric codes:
	- different letters in a text document are given different numeric codes.
	- different pixels (colored dots) in an image are given different numeric codes.
	- different sounds in a music file are given different numeric codes.
- in short, everything is a Number



What can be represented using a Bit?
- computers use binary-the digits 0 and 1-to store data.
- Bits are the smallest unit of data in computing.
- a single Bit can be used to represent two different quantities.
	* ON means TRUE (1) and OFF means FALSE (0)
- therefore it is known as a Binary digit, aka a Bit

Memory Measuring Units
1. Bit 			(1 Bit)
2. Nibble 		(4 Bits)
3. Byte/Octet 	(8 Bits)
4. Kilo- 		(8,000 Bits)
5. Mega- 		(8,000,000 Bits)
6. Giga- 		(8,000,000,000 Bits)
7. Tera- 		(8,000,000,000,000 Bits)
8. Peta- 		(8,000,000,000,000,000 Bits)
9. Zetta- 		(8,000,000,000,000,000,000 Bits)
10. Yotta- 		(8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Bits)

Practice Converting integers to Binary
a. 01110101 = 117
b. 10111011 = 187
c. 01000100 = 68
d. 10100000 = 160
e. 00001111 = 15

- 8 Bits can store a minimum of 0 to 255 decimal values.

Practice Converting characters to ASCII
50 48 52 53 54 		= "20456"
49 57 54 			= "196"
49 48 50 52 		= "1024"
51 50 				= "32"
49 48 48 48 49 53 	= "100015"

1's Complement
- reverse the binary; so 1010 becomes 0101

2's Complement
- reverse the binary then add a 1; so 0111 becomes 1110, then 1001

   1  - 1+1 in binary turns to 0 raised to 1
 0101
+	1
------
 0110

- to find the complement of a decimal, use [f(x) = 256 - x | x < 256]; 
	so 256 - 30 yields 226, which is its complement.
	

What is a Number System?
- it is a technique to represent numbers in the computer system architechture.
- computers support the following:
	1. Decimal Number System; has 10 digits [0123456789]
	2. Binary Number System; has 2 digits [0-1]
	3. Octal Number System; has 8 digits [01234567]
	4. Hexadecimal Number System; has 16 alphanumeric values [0123456789ABCDEF]
